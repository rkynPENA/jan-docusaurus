        ### Stable Releases

        For stable releases, go to [jan.ai](https://jan.ai/).
        For Linux, the download should be available as a `.AppImage` file or a `.deb` file in the following format.

        ```sh
        # AppImage
        jan-linux-x86_64-{version}.AppImage

        # Debian Linux distribution
        jan-linux-amd64-{version}.deb
        ```
        To install Jan on Linux, you should use your package manager's install or `dpkg``.
        
        For Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions, you can install Jan using the following command:

        For other Linux distributions, you launch the AppImage file without installation.

        # Install Jan using AppImage
        chmod +x jan-linux-x86_64-{version}.AppImage
        ./jan-linux-x86_64-{version}.AppImage
        # where jan-linux-x86_64-{version}.AppImage is path to the Jan package
        ```
